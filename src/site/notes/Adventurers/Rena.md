Rena is a Gnome Blasinging Wizard. She inherited a mysterious stone that got her interested in magic and that she now uses as her arcane focus. She was part of a Steorrian expedition secretly looking for magic items in the Scattered Isles. Her use of magic was discovered by her superior, so she ran away.
