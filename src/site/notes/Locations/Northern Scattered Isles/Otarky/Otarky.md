Otarky is an island in the [[Locations/Northern Scattered Isles/Northern Scattered Isles\|Northern Scattered Isles]]. The peculiar climate of the region leads to a frequent heavy fog, as well as unique flora comprising rare species of giant mushrooms that grow in the swampy forests in the middle of the island.

When harvested young and small, these mushrooms are edible and serve as the primary food source for the island. As they mature, their texture becomes too fibrous for consumption, yet they prove valuable as a light yet solid substitute for wood known as [[Shroomwood\|Shroomwood]]. The fibrous mushrooms can also be torn into strands and woven into ropes or cloth.

The town of [[Locations/Northern Scattered Isles/Otarky/Otarkys\|Otarkys]] in the South extracts and processes fibres from the mushrooms while [[Locations/Northern Scattered Isles/Otarky/Otarkyn\|Otarkyn]] in the North specialises in shroomwood.
