The orc Orguk was the captain aboard a ship called *The Arrow* owned by the Steorrian merchant Hugh Bowes. He hired the [[Adventurers/Adventurers\|Adventurers]] for a voyage towards the Siblíns. On the way, tired of taking orders, he staged a mutiny with his crew against his employer to take control of the ship and the secret cargo. Crates in the hold turned out to contain magic items, usually not tolerated by Steorr. During the combat, the ship was attacked by a tentacled sea monster and most of the crew was thrown into the sea. Orguk grabbed onto a tentacle and was carried to [[Locations/Northern Scattered Isles/Eleuthera\|Eleuthera]]. 

The *Arrow* was never heard from again. Devastated by the loss of both the ship and its precious cargo, Orguk travelled to the Pirate Republic on New Destiny. He revealed the secret to the pirates to gain their favour, and they started attacking Steorrian ships in the hope of gathering magic items. Orguk was still a captain without a ship however.
