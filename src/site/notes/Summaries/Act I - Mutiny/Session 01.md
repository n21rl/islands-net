Along with a young halfling named [[People/Bob\|Bob]], they were hired to join the crew of Captain [[People/Orguk\|Orguk]]. The orc worked for the half-elf merchant Hugh [[People/Hugh Bowes\|Bowes]], who had been travelling with a [[Organisations/Steorr/Steorrian army\|Steorrian army]] escort, including the elven sergeant [[People/Elysia\|Elysia]]. The adventurers met [[People/Cook\|Cook]], the Goliath cook and [[People/Kawrl\|Kawrl]], the birdfolk lookout.
