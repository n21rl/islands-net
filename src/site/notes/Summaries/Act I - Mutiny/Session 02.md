The party found themselves beached on a [[Locations/Islands/Northern Scattered Isles/Fort Island\|small unmapped island]], most likely somewhere in the [[Locations/Islands/Northern Scattered Isles/Northern Scattered Isles\|Northern Scattered Isles]]. They were confronted by [[People/Hugh Bowes\|Bowes]] and his escort composed of [[People/Elysia\|Elysia]] and [[Organisations/Steorr/Steorrian army\|Steorrian soldiers]], who had taken [[People/Bob\|Bob]] hostage. Bowes ordered the party to recover a crate stolen by [[People/Orguk\|Orguk]]'s crew, who had been hiding in a ruined fort. The party was to also take control of the ship stationed within the fort's walls. 

After infiltrating the fort through a sea cave, the party made their way up, fighting undead [[Organisations/Steorr/Steorrian army\|Steorrian soldiers]] on the way. They freed an old [[People/Mer woman\|Mer woman]] who apparently had been captured years ago. 

There was no sign of Orguk, but the party came across with the four crew members who had made it to the island: [[People/Cook\|Cook]] the Goliath, [[People/Geera\|Geera]] the half-orc, [[People/Muni\|Muni]] the dwarf, [[People/Kawrl\|Kawrl]] the crow-person. They decided to side with them. From the metal crate the crew had stolen, hidden under a layer of green salt, [[People/Adventurers/Yazim\|Brenlinn]] found a magical cloak.
