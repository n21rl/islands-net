The party devised a plan to rescue [[People/Bob\|Bob]] and flee the island. Using grease, [[People/Adventurers/Gurt\|Gurt]] managed to lower the chain that was blocking the ship. [[People/Adventurers/Yazim\|Brenlinn]] tricked the merchant's team to approach the fort. [[People/Adventurers/Kaihakan\|Kaihakan]] fired a ballista bolt, killing the elven sergeant who seemed the biggest threat. The party, Bob, and the 4 other members of [[Organisations/The Crew\|the crew]] escaped the island aboard the ship, leaving Bowes and his men stranded. 
The crew sailed for a few days and encountered a shimmering fog imbued with strange magical effects. Gurt aged down by about a year after traversing the fog. During the voyage, Brenlinn figured out that the cloak would help swim and breath underwater. While praying to his god, Kaihakan was grabbed by a watery tentacle, which awakened powers in him.
