As they approached an island, the [[Organisations/Adventurers\|party]] was ambushed by another ship. After making it clear they meant no harm, the party met with [[People/Viktor\|Viktor]], the captain. He welcomed them to the island of [[Locations/Islands/Northern Scattered Isles/Otarky/Otarky\|Otarky]] and explained that his small town was seemingly cursed, and the local trade of mushroom-derived products wasn't thriving. Viktor asked the party to investigate the ruined house overlooking the town that used to belong to an alchemist. Many villagers thought it was haunted and the source of the town's bad luck. In exchange the party would receive goods they could trade. [[People/Kawrl\|Kawrl]], who was hurt during the battle would be healed by [[People/Liv\|Liv]], the local vet.

The party explored the house, and found no obvious signs of haunting. Instead, several enchantments produced sounds and illusions. The party found the corpse of [[People/Derrick\|Derrick]], Viktor's brother. They discovered a hidden way to the cellar, where two men tried to fight them off but were rapidly incapacitated. One of these men was [[People/Marius\|Marius]], a mage specialising in illusion magic.
