The next morning, the [[Organisations/Adventurers\|party]] met [[People/Fipp\|Fipp]]'s dads in the swamps where they were working. Fipp hadn't made it home the night before, but that wasn't unusual for him. One of Fipp's fathers said he saw a rowboat flying over the swamp. However, he was going through withdrawal from Hagroot, so hallucinations were to be expected. [[People/Adventurers/Gurt\|Gurt]] harvested a sample of shroomwood, and whittled a beak, the final piece for the large mechanical Northern Goose he had been building. He named his creation Godfrey. 

From his research, [[People/Master Powell\|Master Powell]] had found that the creature responsible for the murder was most likely a male peryton, a monstrous hybrid of a deer and an eagle, with teeth as sharp as a wolf’s. These violent beasts are particularly fond of humanoid hearts and their shadows are said to take the shape of their last human victim. For this reason, some believe that perytons have a kind of human aspect. A powerful magic user could perform an ancient ritual to transform a peryton into a human by transferring the monstrous essence of the beast into the body of a fledgling peryton. Only the human part would remain in the adult, while the young would be doomed to a painful violent existence. The egg found by the children matched the description of a peryton egg and could therefore be a the centre of this ritual. 

The party made their way to the town square, where a meeting to discuss the bird attacks was to take place. They met with [[People/Ham\|Ham]] and his friends, and Fipp handed the egg over to the party. The party devised a clever diversion: [[People/Adventurers/Yazim\|Brenlinn]] created a magical duplicate of the egg and [[People/Adventurers/Kaihakan\|Kaihakan]] hid the real one in their bag of holding. Soon before the meeting was about to start, a large murmuration of starlings formed an eyed in the sky over the square. A woman’s voice, seemingly carried by the birds, filled the air and accused the town of thievery. The starlings then swooped down on the townsfolk, sowing chaos. A large male peryton flew in as well, attacking innocent bystanders in search of the egg. The party fought valiantly, joined by [[People/Bob\|Bob]] and [[People/Muni\|Muni]], who were on shore leave. After an arduous battle, the peryton and possessed birds were killed. Wanting to retrieve the egg from the bag, Kaihakan was bit by the baby peryton, who had hatched during the fight. The question of what to do with the creature was raised. [[People/Sable Martes\|Sable]] offered to buy it to sell it to a menagerie in the Siblíns. Master Powell insisted that the potentially dangerous beast be put down. [[People/Liv\|Liv]] thought the infant did not deserve to die or be imprisoned.
