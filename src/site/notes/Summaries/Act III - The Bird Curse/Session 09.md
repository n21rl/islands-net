[[Adventurers/Gurt\|Gurt]], [[Adventurers/Kaihakan\|Kaihakan]] and [[Adventurers/Yazim\|Brenlinn]] set sail in search of the source of the attacking birds. Guided by the clue [[People/Telmay\|Telmay]] had overheard, they travelled east until arriving at the floating body of a dead whale surrounded by seaweed. As they got in dinghy to get closer, they realized it was enchanted as a floating base. Upon entering, they were greeted by a grotesque [[People/Petrelle\|sea hag]], who had captured a gnome woman, [[Adventurers/Rena\|Rena]], in a cage. After the [[Adventurers/Adventurers\|party]] refused her offer of gifts, and she would not agree to leave the village alone, Gurt cut the ropes around Rena's wrists and a battle ensued. The aura of fear this hag radiated dropped Kaihakan and Brenlin into unconsciousness instantly, but Gurt and Rena bravely fought off the hag and her chimera-like bird/fish creatures. Rena dealt the killing blow with her shadow blade on the sea hag, and Gurt closed her magical clam, freeing the birds. In examining the items left in the whale, some magic items were discovered, along with a bottle containing a note from [[People/Orguk\|Orguk]], the previous Orc captain to the crew.

The group headed back to the village, and impressed by Rena's fighting skills, hired her on as a new member. Once back at the village, the party spoke to [[People/Liv\|Liv]] who had been caring for the baby peryton. The party agreed that so long as Liv was willing to watch over it, and not let it harm any members of the crew, the party would escort the peryton back to its natural habitat in the [[Locations/Jagged Isle/Jagged Isle\|Jagged Isle]]. The party planned to sell shroomwood for a profit in the Jagged Isle, and purchase green salt to trade back. The crew, especially Geera, expressed a desire to find Orguk. Kaihakan called a group meeting and explained while we were not going to sail in that direction yet, with some patience he would talk to Brenlinn and convince him to head to search for Orguk on the way back. 

On their way to the Jagged Isle, the group narrowly escaped a vortex that threatened to swallow the ship. They also passed by a _totally-not-cannibals_ island called [[Locations/Northern Scattered Isles/Traveller's Rest\|Traveller's Rest]]. The party wasn't tired though so they decided not to land... 

Upon arrival at the Jagged Isle, the party, which had all applied a disguise of some sort, were met by the harbourmaster. With some clever storytelling, Kaihakan convinced him that the party were members of the [[Organisations/Steorr/Green Salt Trading Company\|Green Salt Trading Company]] and had just happened to lose their papers in an unfortunate series of events. The harbourmaster allowed the ship to dock and told the party to head down to the main trading house, where they could get as much green salt they could purchase.
