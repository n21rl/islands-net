## Summary
The party met on the main harbour of Star Point, a major Steorrian city on the Grand Isle. Along with a young halfling named Bob, they were hired to join the crew of Captain Orguk. The orc worked for the half-elf merchant Hugh Bowes, who had been travelling with a Steorrian army escort. Shortly after setting sail towards the Sibl√≠n Islands, fed up with taking orders from Bowes, Orguk convinced the new hires to join him and his crew in taking control of the ship and its secret cargo. During the battle that ensued, the ship was attacked and destroyed by a sea monster.
