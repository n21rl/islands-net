The party found themselves beached on a small unmapped island, most likely somewhere in the Northern Scattered Isles. They were confronted by Bowes and his escort, who had taken Bob hostage. Bowes ordered the party to recover a crate stolen by Orguk's crew, who had been hiding in a ruined fort. The party was to also take control of the ship stationed within the fort's walls. After infiltrating the fort through a sea cave, the party made their way up, fighting undead Steorrian soldiers on the way. They freed an old Mer woman who apparently had been captured years ago. There was no sign of Orguk, but the party came across with the four crew members who had made it to the island: Cook the Goliath, Geera the half-orc, Muni the dwarf, Kawrl the crow-person. They decided to side with them. From the metal crate the crew had stolen, hidden under a layer of green salt, Brenlinn found a magical cloak.
