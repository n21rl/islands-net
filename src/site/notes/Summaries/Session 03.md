The party devised a plan to rescue Bob and flee the island. Using grease, Gurt managed to lower the chain that was blocking the ship. Brenlinn tricked the merchant's team to approach the fort. Kaihakan fired a ballista bolt, killing the elven sergeant who seemed the biggest threat. The party, Bob, and the 4 other members of the crew escaped the island aboard the ship, leaving Bowes and his men stranded. The crew sailed for a few days and encountered a shimmering fog imbued with strange magical effects. Gurt aged down by about a year after traversing the fog. During the voyage, Brenlinn figured out that the cloak would help swim and breath underwater. While praying to his god, Kaihakan was grabbed by a watery tentacle, which awakened powers in him.
