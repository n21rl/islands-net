After gathering information about a lantern-based communication system, the party discovered secret passages to the old alchemist's lab and to sea caves below the house. They ventured further down under the house, coming across what was apparently the hideout of a group of smugglers who had been stealing goods in the region. The party killed several bandits but decided to retreat to the town when it looked like they would be overwhelmed.
